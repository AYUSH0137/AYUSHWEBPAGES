    <h1>Our story</h1> 

    <p>April 2016 when I was working  part-time at a travel agency. At the time, there was an environmental problem in my country that made many people angry and they created a petition on Change dot org and shared it on facebook. I am very interested in the idea of this website, it is really helpful and it has a strong life impact. I wonder why there is not a such a website in my country? I think every country should have such a website and the world should have nore than one in the community. So I decided to quit my part-time job and start developing a platform.</p>

    <p>Although I have some experience developing websites on Wordpress at my company, I still face many challenges to develop and design. I work almost 12 hours a day, after 1o months the first version is released.  </p>

    <p>Today, hundreds of websites powered by campoal are running around the world, millions of people are signing to support for the problem they care about, People have used websites to change tax laws in France, raise funds to protect animals in Germany, speak out about social problems in Turkey, Calls for an end to war in Middle Eastern Countries Fundraising to help children in Africa and more.  </p>
  
    <p>By empowering entrepreneurs and organizations to give people the oppurtunity to talk about their problems, believe that anyone can make the world a better place.</p>
